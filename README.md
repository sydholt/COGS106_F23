## Scientific Python

### Python has a large number of tools available for doing data science, sometimes referred to as 'scientific Python'. 

### The scientific Python ecosystem revolves around some a set of core modules, including:

- Numerical Python `numpy` https://numpy.org/
- File I/O and Data Analysis/Visualization `pandas` http://pandas.pydata.org/
- Data Visualization `matplotlib` https://matplotlib.org/
- Advanced Data Visualization `seaborn` https://seaborn.pydata.org/
- Scientific Python (Signal Processing and Statistics) `scipy`  https://scipy.org/
- Machine Learning `scikit-learn` https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
